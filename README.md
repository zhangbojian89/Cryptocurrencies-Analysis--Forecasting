# Cryptocurrencies-Analysis--Forecasting
Cryptocurrency : Advanced Analysis & Forecasting
This project is devoted to system analysis and forecasting of the given cryptocurrency (for example, "BTC" = Bitcoin, but it is easy to replace in the variable "cryptocurrency"):

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering (FE) - synthesis and research of new features (internal and external factors)
Data preprocessing and get target
Building and tuning of many models of Machine Learning (ML) and choosing the optimal among them
Data forecasting
Analysis of forecasting accuracy and the importance of features
This notebook section provides examples of identifying the following ML models (but the list goes on):

Facebook Prophet
ARIMA (and AutoARIMA)
Linear Regression
KNeighbors Regressor
Support Vector Machines
Linear SVR
Random Forest Regressor
Bagging Regressor
XGB Regressor
MLP Regressor
