# Cryptocurrencies-Analysis--Forecasting
This notebook is devoted to **system analysis and forecasting of the given cryptocurrency** (for example, "BTC" = Bitcoin, but it is easy to replace in the variable "cryptocurrency"): 
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering (FE) - synthesis and research of new features (internal and external factors)
* Data preprocessing and get target
* Building and tuning of many models of Machine Learning (ML) and choosing the optimal among them 
* Data forecasting 
* Analysis of forecasting accuracy and the importance of features

This notebook section provides examples of identifying the following **ML models** (but the list goes on):
* Facebook Prophet 
* ARIMA (and AutoARIMA)
* Linear Regression
* KNeighbors Regressor
* Support Vector Machines
* Linear SVR
* Random Forest Regressor
* Bagging Regressor
* XGB Regressor
* MLP Regressor
